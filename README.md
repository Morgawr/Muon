Muon is a self-destructible private file host. You run this on your web server and upload files
and text for your friends. You can set a limit to number of views or a time limit after which a
file will self-destruct and won't be available anymore.

It's really simple, I made this in an afternoon for myself. If you like it, feel free to use it.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 1.7.0 or above installed.

    lein ring server
